        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>xp4eternity was founded in September of 2023 succeeding Miami-Dade Refuse. xp4eternity's mission is to bring productivity and improvements to Linux distros as well as making Windows XP a little more useful each and every day. Most of my projects will also be compatible with Windows XP. You can learn more about us in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/trashmaster15">about</a> section.</p>
        <h2>Garbage Truck Era</h2>
        <p>Before I got into programming, I was into garbage trucks. My full-time filming began April 2020 and ended July 2023. My photography can be found in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/curottocanman">photography</a> section.</p>
        <h2>Programming Era</h2>
        <p>August 2023 was primarily focused on winding down garbage truck filming and growth in Windows XP theming. September 2023 was where programming starts to take light. I am currently working on an A.S in Internet of Things or IoT for short. I am planning to get a B.S in Software Engineering after the A.S. You can find my projects in the <a href="techcentre.html">computer</a> section or in my GitHub.</p>
