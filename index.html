        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>xp4eternity was founded in September of 2023 succeeding Miami-Dade Refuse. xp4eternity's mission is to bring a Windows XP environment to Windows and to Linux distros. You can learn more about us in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/trashmaster15">about</a> section.</p>
        <h2>Pre-Programming Era</h2>
        <p>Before I got into programming, I was into Garbage trucks. My full-time filming began on the 24th of April of 2020 and ended on the 26th of July of 2023. Photos and videos of the trucks can be found in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/curottocanman">garbage truck</a> section.</p>
        <h2>Programming Era</h2>
        <p>August 2023 was primarily focused on winding down garbage truck filming and growth in Windows XP theming. September 2023 was where programming starts to take light. I am currently working on an A.S in Internet of Things or IoT for short. I am planning to get a B.S in Software Engineering after the A.S. you can find my projects in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/midwesttrashtrucks">computer</a> section or in my GitHub.</p>
